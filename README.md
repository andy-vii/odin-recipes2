# odin-recipes2
Odin Project recipes website, version 2.

The purpose of this project is to practice the basics of html, such as links, images, lists, and basic layout. By the end of the project I hope to be able to smoothly create a basic framework for developing a website without having to constantly cross-reference knowledge bases.

The website contains a landing page from which all recipes can be accessed. All recipe pages will also have a link back to the landing page (index).
